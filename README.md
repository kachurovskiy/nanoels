# NanoEls H2

Cheap DIY Electronic Lead Screw (ELS) based on Arduino Nano for metal lathes. No more greasy gear swapping! Control your metal lathe lead screw with a few clicks.

- Set leadscrew pitch for feed or thread
- Soft limits for the carriage
- Multi-start threads in 1 start of the spindle

See [h2 folder for parts list, software, assembly and usage manual](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/blob/main/h2/). Controller can be built from [generally available components](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/tree/main/h2#components).

It's suggested to use STEPPERONLINE CL57T closed-loop driver with NEMA 23 3NM motor or stronger with 200 step resolution mode (full step) and a 600 PPR optical rotary encoder. [See hardware.md for more info.](hardware.md)
